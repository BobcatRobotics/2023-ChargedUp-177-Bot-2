**TODO before Battlecry**
- get a working sample of data logging working with all of our original features
- tune our auto-align system and double check the logic for being red
- change the pose estimation logic to use the gyro readings from the april tags to assist with field-oriented driving and rotation during autos
- update and create new autos for use at battlecry (likely 3 pieces from both of the wings and then just adjusting the balances if there's time)
